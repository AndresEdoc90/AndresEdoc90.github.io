	<h2>Topic Reflection</h2>
	<p>In the discourse community of software developers there is a topic that has sprung many conversations and arguments, and it is my first choice for my paper’s topic.  The argument stems from the base of a pretty simple ideal.  Should one be a well-rounded scholar? Or should they be knowledgeable of just the material they will need for the job at hand?  This is the basis of the conversation that I chose;   should future software developers pursue a traditional four year degree in order to be prepared for the job and hopefully landing a position as a developer, or are they better off attending a coding boot camp; an intensive period ranging from 3-6 months that attempt to equip an individual with the tools they need to successfully find a job.
	This topic hits very close to home being that I am currently into my third year of my bachelor’s degree for software development.  I feel like this can be both a pro and a con for me in that I could partially be biased towards one side of the argument, but I feel like this is such a hotly debated proponent of the discourse community that it is well worth the effort into gaining my own insight into the topic and thus preparing my entrance into the conversation.  In regards to the bias, it should not be too difficult considering that for research interviews will be conducted with hopeful, current and past students of both sides.  The fact that I have access to many of these individuals who would be more than happy to share their opinions and  experiences is definitely a pro since it allows for me to interview a diverse sample group of the discourse community.  I will leave out my opinion on the matter and solely rely on what I can gather from others assertions and experiences.  To build on the information gathered through the interviews I will gather statistics from academic articles and prior research done on the topic to use in comparison parallel to what I gather from the interviews.
	For this topic to be manageable for the semester I will focus on career opportunities.  The possibility of this topic getting to broad if I did not do so is definitely a con for the topic but one I believe can be navigated if focused in on a specific component of the argument and conversation.  The questions in the interview phase of the research will have an inclination towards that specific aspect of the argument but by no means will it be the only subject gathered since I will also want an overall feeling for how each individual feels about their choice and their feelings for the other side of the argument. Again, this is by far my more passionate choice for the paper but it is not my only option.
	The second topic I am considering for the research paper is the abuse of social media and the impact it is having on our generation.  The discourse community that I am hoping to enter into conversation with is that of millennials.  It is well documented that social media has made a lot of beneficial contributions to society and the world but I want to focus on the issue on its abuse and the ramifications on my generation’s culture and society. The main concern with this topic is the question of millennials counting as a discourse group but I feel that it exhibits a few of the traits that are associated with discourse groups.  I do worry it might not be narrow enough of a discourse group but feel like the issue is one that really matters to not just me but to many others.  We have all been witnesses to or been guilty to the abuse of social media and instead of using it for its intended purpose of connecting to all of your friends and family, it is the cause of disconnect from those closest around us.  
	Academic essays and studies done on the subject will be used to conduct research on this issue.  Using these resources, an overall view on the issue will be formed and then compared to research gathered from interviewing millennials.  The main pro in choosing this topic is to hopefully bring awareness to an issue that is greatly effecting my generation and to better understand it myself.
	The final choice for my issue is one that focuses again on the discourse group of software developers, but this time the focus is on an issue pertaining specifically to the female portion of the group.  Sexism has been a long standing issue in many parts of our society but it holds a special strangle hold in the field of IT, and more specifically developers.  There are still many reported incidents of sexism and inequality but not a lot being done to fix it.  It is a fact that there is a huge shortage of females in the profession of software developers, and that is exactly the discourse group I will focus on.  This topic holds many possible difficulties and challenges, but it also represents a unique and great opportunity.  First, as a male, I can be seen as not the most obvious individual to attempt to enter this argument but I view that as a pro.  This will challenge me into organizing my thoughts on the issue appropriately as well as a chance to interview not only female developers but male ones as well in hopes of obtaining a better understanding on any underlying reasons for this lack of equality in the field.  To compliment the interview portion of the research, I will research articles written on the subject by some of the leading female software developers in the world.  
My paper, regardless of the issue, will take form of a blog post since this is the principle genre in which many who are involved in the field of technology.  It will not be a casually written blog, instead it will be more of an educational blog that provided detailed statistics; as well as quotes gathered from all the interviews conducted across the research phase.

	<h2>Proposal</h2>
	<p>
	The question I have decided to research is one that is relatively new and also pertinent to myself; the question being is a four year college degree in software development better in preparing an aspiring developers for the career versus attending coding boot camp.  Traditionally the only option had always been the four year college route being that it was the only option available.  This has drastically changed over the past decade upon the emergence and proceeding surge of coding boot camps.  The main appeal about these boot camps is that instead of spending four years at a university or college,  you spend three to six months attending these camps where you spend anywhere from eight to twelve hours a day learning to code.   This has given rise to the debate in the discourse community of software developers on which one prepares you for the field more appropriately, with no clear winner yet decided.  For that reason I want to research this question, gathering information and feedback from multiple sources and attempt find an answer to at least fulfill my desire know the answer.
	My preliminary research has primarily been reaching out to software developers from different academic backgrounds and interviewing them.  I have successfully interviewed 3 developers at this point but to gain a true sample of data that represents the opinions and views of the question I plan to interview fifteen to twenty developers’ total.  What I have learned from these preliminary interviews is that there will most likely not be an obvious consensus on which is the better of the two options in regards to my research question.  I have decided that my initial question set for my interviews left room for the answer to be to broad which is most likely a result of my intent to make the questions very open ended so that the developers could really express their belief and opinions freely. Initially I thought this would lead to more honest responses and allow for me to gather the information I needed but instead the responses would tend to tail of into different topics and not directly correlate to my question.  From the information I have gathered I can say that the importance of the general skills and education you acquire in a four year university or college are held in high regards.  At the same time, the amount of coding and the technologies learned in the boot camps is far greater in comparison to universities.  
	Through further research and a more fine-tuned question set I hope to have definitive points and data that supports either four year colleges or boot camps as well as discovering variables that I had not considered and compare them to the academic articles I plan to read regarding the subject.  Ultimately, I hope to be able to add to the ongoing conversation on the subject in a meaningful way that hopefully brings some insight and clarity on this ongoing discourse discussion.

	<h2>Stakeholder and Genre Analysis</h2>
	
	<p>
	Part One: Stakeholder Analysis
	For my research question of whether attending a traditional four year college and obtaining a degree in a computer science related field or attending a computer programming boot camp better prepared you for your potential career.  I was able to discern the main stakeholders of the discourse group of software developers by breaking the group into three separate groups; past students of either or, current students of either or and potential or future students.  By separating them up into groups I was able to come identify the stakeholders that would be most interested in this question being answered as well as who would benefit the most. I feel like aiming my research.  The two groups I will focus on is current and future students.

	The people that make up the future and potential students turned out to be pretty hard to identify.  The problem was that I went into my research believing that I should focus on an age group but quickly came to realize just how diverse in age these stakeholders were.  I interview a man in his late 40’s that had come to a programming meetup in hopes of better understanding the potential career.  He was tired of his current career and decided to try his luck on the one thing he was always passionate about; that thing being technology.  This made me reassess how I viewed the discourse community and my assumptions on who would be interested in my research topic.  To these stakeholders, any insight into any information that can help them in their pursuit of the career they desire in software developing will be of the most importance.  Hopefully after reading my blog post they will be better informed and equipped to make or change their decision on which route to take, that is what I hope to do by answering the topic question.
Part Two: Genre Analysis
 	For the stakeholders that are future or potential students, they do not typically know all the different forms of genre that the discourse community used since more often than not they are relatively new to the group.  I came to gather that a lot of these stakeholders research the question themselves on the internet using search engines like google.  By way of these searches they find blog posts that cover the topic seeing that there are not a plethora of academic papers and research to help them and they are more trusting of those that have experience in one or the other of college or boot camps.  Lucky for them the favorite genre for developers to express their ideas and opinions is the use of blogs.  The same can be said for current students; through my own knowledge and experience as well as those of the people I interviewed I understood that this genre would be the most suitable in reaching my stakeholders.
