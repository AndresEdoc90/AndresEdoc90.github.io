	<h2>Four Year College vs Coding Boot Camps</h2>
	
	<p>During our childhood we were all told the tale of the tortuous and there hare.  The tale that taught us the lesson of slow and steady wins the race, patience in other words.  And for the better part of 5 decades this lesson was true for software developers.  Go to a university, get a four year degree in computer science, and get a job. Tried, tested and true.  But over the last decade there has been a newcomer to the tech education scene; the hare in the scenario, coding boot camps.  Attendees of boot camps go through 3-6 months of intensive 8 hour days learning all the fundamentals of programming with the hope of having you job ready, many providing assistance and on some occasion guarantees.  And that’s the carrot at the end of the string, a new career after a few months that can change your life.  But for potential developers, which one is the better option in preparing you for a career in the field.
	As a current student of a university in pursuit of a CS degree, this is a question which really interested me.  I had not heard of boot camps before attending university and now three years into my degree I feel like my path is set in stone; but I wanted to answer that question regardless and I chose to enlist the help of potential, current and past students of both. 
	Researching boot camps has proven to be quite the difficult task though as there are so many in operation and all have various curriculum, lengths, and pricing.   And if this post consisted of nothing but statistics and numbers on the percentage of graduates that find work it would be the same as most blogs pertaining to the subject.  I chose to gather the thoughts and opinions of those that are most impacted by this question by interviewing those who were willing to talk to me; and their responses were enlightening.  To better separate this post I will separate them into three groups; potential, current and past students.  

POTENTIAL
	This group was the ones that varied the most on their responses.  When I asked what their views on what a four year college can provide versus a boot camp the overwhelming response was prestige.  Many of them felt that having the degree from a four year college would help them when it came to getting a job.  What did catch me by surprise was that a lot of them were aware of the coding boot camps and what they had to offer, a stark contrast from many people a few years ago including myself.  They are more exposed to the benefits of these boot camps as well as hearing about more success stories happening each year.  These stories of success were constantly brought up making it hard to ignore; interviewee Paul Patterson stated “Looking at all these people who attend these camps for a couple months landing jobs right off the bat makes you take a closer look at them”. These potential students have to choose between greater prestige on paper or immediate return when they pick their academic future.
CURRENT
	Among current students, I found that less boot camp students regret their decision when it comes to their chose of schooling compared to four year college students, with 5 four year students regretting their choice.  Being a university student myself I sympathized with a lot of their regrets, mainly around the lack of real world application of the subjects we learn.
